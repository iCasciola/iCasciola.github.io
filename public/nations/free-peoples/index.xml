As you can see, there is very little info below, just ask me for more info and I&amp;rsquo;ll send you more lore, and we can figure out why your not chilling in the clouds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extremely little is known about these peoples.In the modern period, the Storm Riders seem closer to a large cult than they do an esteemed civilization. They hide in the clouds and are essentially unknown to the rest of the world. They worship a god they call Sturm, and wield powerful  magics based on storms. Lightning, wind, and rain are their favored materials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two cities whose hearts are seperated by a days carriage ride on paved stone, their outskirts stretch to touch each other, intermingling in the middle. Their centers are guarded by two sets of walls and dozens guard towers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The southern city is called Port Miracle, situated on the Gulf of Miracle it started as a collection of fishing towns, with a high amount of trade. They combined and built a fort to protect themselves and continued to grow, eventually expanding outside their defensive walls.&#xA;The northern city is called Siegetown. It started as the military camp for a three year siege against Port Miracle by the Tricorn King. Now, it is home to many schools of combat and the city has a deep history of martial prowess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
