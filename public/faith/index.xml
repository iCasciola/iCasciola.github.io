      <description>&lt;p&gt;These beings/faiths are more than the other religions, their influence is observed and provable, yet they are definitevly less than gods, and decidedly different from the Dragons. No one can be quite sure if they are good or evil, helpful or harmful, human or monster. But they are real, and they are powerful. Often feared and worshipped in equal measure, they are the favored subjects of niche cults and small temples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;draconic-cults&#34;&gt;Draconic Cults:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The largest group of faithful are dragon worshippers. Going by many names and each with their own unique creeds, followers worship the ancient dragons, seeking out mighty works and old wisdom. Some of them latch on to a modern dragon as a connection to the ancients, elevating them to a divine creature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;crown&#34;&gt;Crown:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second largest faith, they believe those with Crowns are living gods, divine beings with unimaginable power they use to shape the world to their liking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
