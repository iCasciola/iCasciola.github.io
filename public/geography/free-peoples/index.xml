      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though the Smith King and his people rule in the Dizazhra Mines, overhead, the mountain folk remain independent, with dozens of distinct tribes. They have a long history of warring for land and resources. However, when foreign groups try to invade, many  tribes will ally and mount a dangerous defense. With access to high quality steel at the surface, they have often enjoyed superior weaponry and armor, and in the post shattering have tightly kept secret techniques for making advanced firearms and gunpowder&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DM! DM! Can I be one of these guys??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course! As you can see, there is very little info below, just ask me for more info and I&amp;rsquo;ll send you more lore, and we can figure out why your not chilling in the clouds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extremely little is known about these peoples.In the modern period, the Storm Riders seem closer to a large cult than they do an esteemed civilization. They hide in the clouds and are essentially unknown to the rest of the world. They worship a god they call Sturm, and wield powerful  magics based on storms. Lightning, wind, and rain are their favored materials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A city in its own right, The Great Library has existed since before the shattering war. They have a headquarters in the North of the continent, but have hundreds of smaller outposts where scholars gather to collect and study ancient tomes, conduct research, and hoard knowledge scattered throughout the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, they act as a mostly benevolent force. As an organization they have no push towards accumulating power (in the traditional sense), though some individuals may try and steer them that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two cities whose hearts are seperated by a days carriage ride on paved stone, their outskirts stretch to touch each other, intermingling in the middle. Their centers are guarded by two sets of walls and dozens guard towers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The southern city is called Port Miracle, situated on the Gulf of Miracle it started as a collection of fishing towns, with a high amount of trade. They combined and built a fort to protect themselves and continued to grow, eventually expanding outside their defensive walls.&#xA;The northern city is called Siegetown. It started as the military camp for a three year siege against Port Miracle by the Tricorn King. Now, it is home to many schools of combat and the city has a deep history of martial prowess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
