title: "Twin Cities"
---
Two cities whose hearts are seperated by a days carriage ride on paved stone, their outskirts stretch to touch each other, intermingling in the middle. Their centers are guarded by two sets of walls and dozens guard towers. 

The southern city is called Port Miracle, situated on the Gulf of Miracle it started as a collection of fishing towns, with a high amount of trade. They combined and built a fort to protect themselves and continued to grow, eventually expanding outside their defensive walls.
The northern city is called Siegetown. It started as the military camp for a three year siege against Port Miracle by the Tricorn King. Now, it is home to many schools of combat and the city has a deep history of martial prowess.

The cities consider themselves the rightful heirs of the Tricorn King, and their princes await his return when order can be restored and the kingdom renewed.
