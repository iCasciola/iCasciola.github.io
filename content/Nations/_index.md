The world as a whole is divided between the nation states ruled by the Dragons, and free nations in between their borders.
## [Dragons](./Dragons/)
Dragons are the God-Rulers of Tu'um Mundi. They wear the Crowns made by the ancient draconic gods, and use them to enforce their will across their realms. 

Currently, there are seven dragons across the shattered continent. 

## [Free Peoples](./Free%20Peoples/)
Every single city-state, village, town, nomadic tribe, is a "Free Nation." A group of peoples who fall outside the borders of the Dragons.
