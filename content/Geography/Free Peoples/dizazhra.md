title: "Dizazhra Mountain People"
---
Though the Smith King and his people rule in the Dizazhra Mines, overhead, the mountain folk remain independent, with dozens of distinct tribes. They have a long history of warring for land and resources. However, when foreign groups try to invade, many  tribes will ally and mount a dangerous defense. With access to high quality steel at the surface, they have often enjoyed superior weaponry and armor, and in the post shattering have tightly kept secret techniques for making advanced firearms and gunpowder

Their disparate nature and great skill with fightning have put them at odds with the Smith king in the past, and they have remained free. Mostly. There are some tribes that consider it easier and better for them to ally with the Smith King. others trade, and some choose to kill outsiders on sight.

Most often, tribes follow a form of democracy, with laws and leaders voted on by all adults in the tribe.

They speak a number of dialects of the same base language. Often they can understand the majority of what each other say.

They value independence and self-determination on a tribal level, and loyalty and sacrifice on an individual leve. Their greatest heros are those who died fightning invaders, even if their death didn't help the overall effort. Sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice.

Buildings are usually stone built from slate and animal hides.
