title: "The Great Library"
---
A city in its own right, The Great Library has existed since before the shattering war. They have a headquarters in the North of the continent, but have hundreds of smaller outposts where scholars gather to collect and study ancient tomes, conduct research, and hoard knowledge scattered throughout the continent.

In general, they act as a mostly benevolent force. As an organization they have no push towards accumulating power (in the traditional sense), though some individuals may try and steer them that way.
