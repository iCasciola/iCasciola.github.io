> Of course! As you can see, there is very little info below, just ask me for more info and I'll send you more lore, and we can figure out why your not chilling in the clouds

Extremely little is known about these peoples.In the modern period, the Storm Riders seem closer to a large cult than they do an esteemed civilization. They hide in the clouds and are essentially unknown to the rest of the world. They worship a god they call Sturm, and wield powerful  magics based on storms. Lightning, wind, and rain are their favored materials.

> Unless you have a specific reason your character knows them, probably not
