Extremely little is known about these peoples. In the modern period, the Storm Riders seem closer to a large cult than they do an esteemed civilization. They hide in the clouds and are essentially unknown to the rest of the world. They worship a god they call Sturm, and wield powerful  magics based on storms. Lightning, wind, and rain are their favored materials.
