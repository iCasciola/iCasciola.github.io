Land of Losara, the Grass Queen. A veritable utoptia. Green fields as far as the eye can see, beautiful forests, clear watered lakes and rivers. No one goes hungry, everyone pitches in, and no outsiders allowed. Through sheer force of will violence has been outlawed, and Losara always seems to know. Violations result in exile, no exceptions.
