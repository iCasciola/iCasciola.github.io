title: "Mithral"

The land of the Smith King. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands of miles of tunnels and caverns. Some carved by hand, some carved by dragons, and some developed from natural forces. Dwarves have spread through the entire area under the Dizazrha mountain range. They mostly gather in massive cities. They organize into clans, loosely connected by blood and bond. 

The Smith King's influence covers the entire mountain range. Under his protection and governed by his hand selected council of ministers. Many skilled craftsmen create weapons and armor from precious minerals found int he mountains.

They have a strong sense of local community, and outsiders aren't trusted easily. They expect to see the same faces every day, and only trade with familiar people

Houses are carved directly from the strone or built from rocks left over from carving.

They have an appreciation for time, and it is traditional for families to have great artworks they they will add too over the course of generations.
