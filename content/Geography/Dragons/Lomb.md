title: "Lomb"
---
The land of The Sword King. Before Solomon took the Crown from the previous dragon 12 years ago, the land was a conglomerate of city states that operated as a single nation. Now, the city states are isolated and fearful of each other, and all answer to the King. 

The vasts majority of Lomb is covered by the Candlestick Dunes, large pillars of stone that dot an otherwise flat landscape. Cities and settlements are mostly built into the pillars with small towns dotted throughout the dunes.
