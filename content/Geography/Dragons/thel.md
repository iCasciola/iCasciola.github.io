title: "Thel"
---
Thel, the large domain of the Bright Queen Thela, mostly covered by the Thel Forest. The fast flowing Strik River runs through it's center and connects its largest cities. It's northern edge disappears into the Void.

# Population
The land has a population of just over a million people total spread throughout several hundred towns and burgs, most of which are unnamed, and a few dozen large towns and less than five major cities. 
Thel Forest  is populated mostly by elves  living in their ancestral homes, with the edges of the forest colonized by  Humans .
The mountains to the north and to the west are homes to distinct clans of  Dwarves .
The plains to the northeast are homes to families of  Halflings  while the hills to the southwest are homes to  Gnomes .

# Outside the Borders
The land between Thel and Sola is filled with nomadic tribes of orcs and dragonborn, with  Oberpoint  serving as an established city in the center of the Badlands.
The land between the Bright Queen's land and the  Land of the Grass Queen  is settled and rules by a king with no  Crowns  who rules from  The Twin Cities 

# Quality of Life
The Bright Queen takes care of her subjects, but is also acutely aware of how large her territory is. She is forced to allow some autonomy from a selected group of loyal vassals, selected from the ranks of people she believes she can trust. 

# The Queen's Road
Running throughout her Kingdom runs the Queen's Road, a paved road that is regularly patrolled and cared for by royal engineers. It connects all the largest cities and the larger towns, with local dirt roads serving all the smaller towns that don't make it onto the maps.
The Queen's Chosen  regularly patrol the road, and stocked forts can be found roughly every 100 miles of road, keeping the land safe, while also helping to remind the people that the Queen is always there.

# Capital
 Ebelburg
