# Draconic Cults:
The largest group of faithful are dragon worshippers. Going by many names and each with their own unique creeds, followers worship the ancient dragons, seeking out mighty works and old wisdom. Some of them latch on to a modern dragon as a connection to the ancients, elevating them to a divine creature.

# Crown:
The second largest faith, they believe those with Crowns are living gods, divine beings with unimaginable power they use to shape the world to their liking.

# Listeners: 
A small, unorganized, but widespread faith. Worshippers believe the Voices of the World are messages from the gods. They train to be able to listen and try to interperet what they hear. Often gathering in secluded monestaries, meditating to try and hear.

# Mountain Faiths:
Polytheistic religions practiced mostly by those outside the rule of Dragons, gathered on or near mountains. Usually they consist of nature gods, storm gods, sun gods, and other fivine representations of the natural world.

# Cult of the Void:
People who live on the edges of the world, particularly close to the void, are susceptible to go mad as the nothigness creeps into their brains. Some choose to accept the void as a thing worth worshipping, and will even sacrifice people and things to it to try and earn its divine favor.

# Padrishians
Similar to those who believe that all Dragons are gods, these follower specifically believe that King Padrish, the Tricorn King, is not dead and his power still exists tangibly in the world.
