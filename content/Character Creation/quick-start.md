Read this page if you don't really want to read all of the lore. This page is the absolute basics you need to know for creating a character.

### The World
All that remains after a great war 1000 years ago is a single continent, surrounded by the void on all  sides.

### Nations
The world is divided between 7 nations led by god-kings who possess extremely powerful Crowns, and free peoples who live between their borders.

### Religion
There  is no "true" religion, but instead many different interpretations of the divine. 

### Adventuring
The lands are covered in ruins from ancient fallen kingdoms, and at the center of the continent is the remains of the capital of this kingdom, extremely dangerous, but filled with treasure.

### Starting Location and Quest
You (as a party/as an individual) have been hired by a group of refugee caravaners to escort them somewhere safe.
